# Welcome to our Playbook



At Obvious, we’re working to build an inclusive company with a value-driven culture. That’s an easy thing to want and say, but it’s difficult to practice because exclusion is often the default in our industries \(both software and consulting\). It takes active effort to find the hidden biases in our companies and remove them.

One of our core values is to be "**public by default**": this repository therefore contains nearly all of the policies and practices that we use at Obvious. It represents many hours of research, lots of thoughtful debates, and some serious introspection. It’s certainly not perfect, but we think it’s a great place to start.

Feel free to fork this repository and use any or all of these policies, and to modify them in whatever way makes sense for your company. We hope that by publishing them, other companies can benefit from our research and make their own policies more inclusive.

All feedback and suggestions _\(especially in the form of pull requests\)_ are appreciated. We’ve gotten several different perspectives to help arrive at these policies, but we are certainly missing many more and making mistakes as a result. This is a work in progress that we hope will get better with more time and more contributors.

If these policies sound like a place where you want to work, please do look through our [open career listings](https://jobs.obvious.in/).
