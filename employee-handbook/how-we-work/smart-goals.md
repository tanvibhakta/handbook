# SMART Goals

At Obvious, we believe that in addition to our people, our goals should be SMART. SMART goals, allow both the manager and team member to define requirements, track progress, and improve communication of expectations for success.

**SMART** is an acronym that can be used in creating all sorts of requirements. To make sure goals, are clear and reachable, each one should be:

* **Specific:** Specifically define what you expect the employee to do/deliver. Avoid generalities and use action verbs as much as possible.
* **Measurable:** You should be able to measure whether the employee is meeting the goals, or not. Identify how you will measure success - usually stated in terms of quantity, quality, timeliness or cost \(e.g. increase by 25%\).
* **Achievable:** Make sure that accomplishing the goal is within the employee's realm of authority and capabilities. While considering whether a goal is actionable/achievable, you also need to consider the employee's total set of goals. While each individual goal may be achievable, overall, you may be assigning the employee more goals, than they can reasonably be expected to successfully complete.
* **Realistic:** Can the employee realistically achieve the objectives with the resources available? Ensure the goal is practical, results-oriented and within the employees realm of authority and capabilities. Also, Relevant: Where appropriate, link the goal to a higher-level departmental or organizational goal, and ensure that the employee understands how their goal and actions contributes to the attainment of the higher level goal. This give the employee a context for their work.
* **Time-bound:** When does the objective need to be completed? Specify when the goal needs to be completed \(e.g. by the end of the quarter, or every month\).

#### **Sample SMART Goals:**

* **Bad :** "Improve overall qualified sales lead".
* **Good:** "In May, June and July, Kaveri must have an increase of 20% in overall qualified sales leads entered into Pipedrive"
* **Bad:** "Increase Fix defects"
* **Good:** "Fix at least 8 defects. Must be fixed with code changes, not closing as "Won't Fix, "Not Reproducible". All defects must be dev completed/merged by end of business Monday, June 1st, 2020"
