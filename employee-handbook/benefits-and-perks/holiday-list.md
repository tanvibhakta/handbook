## Special Occasions

For special occasions \(think: your wedding, sibling's graduation, best friend's wedding\) your manager can grant you an extra 10 days of paid leave. This is considered on a case-by-case basis.

## Very Sick Leave

In case you're very sick because of a certain illness and need significant time to recover \(think: dengue, chickenpox\), the leaves you take will not be counted towards any quota. Please talk to your manager so that we can help you in any way possible, and work can be managed accordingly.
