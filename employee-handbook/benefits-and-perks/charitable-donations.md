# Charitable Donations

\(stolen from [_Nilenso_](https://nilenso.com/)_\)_

There are many worthy charities. It is impossible to construct a partial order \(is “save the whales” more important or “save the Western Ghats”?\) much less the total order of all causes we might support. To avoid endless debate and focus on execution, we will have a one-for-one, “put your money where your mouth is” policy for charity.

## Decision

A personal donation made by an individual at Obvious, will be matched by Obvious. This rule has one exemption which is when Obvious is asked for a donation directly, in which case it is up for discussion.
