# Equal Opportunity Employment

Obvious is an Equal Opportunity Employer. The company supports diversity and inclusion in its core values and does not discriminate against qualified employees or applicants based on race, color, religion, gender identity, sex, sexual preference, sexual identity, pregnancy, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, age, marital status, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, military status, or any other characteristic protected by Indian national or state law or local ordinance. This Policy is meant to provide a safe, diverse and comfortable workplace at Obvious. This Policy is not legally mandated and, therefore, is not judicially enforceable in India. This Policy is without prejudice to any anti-discrimination provisions of applicable law including, but not restricted to, the provisions of:

* Article 17 of the Constitution of India;
* the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955,
* the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes \(Prevention of Atrocities\) Act, 1989;
* the Sexual Harassment of Women at the Workplace \(Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal\) Act, 2013;
* Sections 354 and 509 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860; and,
* the Persons with Disabilities \(Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation\) Act, 1995.

This policy governs all aspects of employment including, selection, job assignment, compensation, discipline, termination and access to benefits and training.

Obvious will not adversely discriminate, and prohibits other adverse discrimination at the workplace, on the basis of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, descent, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, age or any of them \("Discrimination Characteristics"\). Obvious will not condone any adverse discrimination against any person on its premises, whether that person is in its employment or otherwise.

Any person who believes herself to have been subjected to adverse discrimination on the basis of the Discrimination Characteristics is encouraged to bring the matter to the attention of the management at Obvious at the earliest practical opportunity. No person will be punished, retaliated against, or limited in employment or other opportunity for exercising anything set out in this Policy, or for filing a complaint, furnishing information for, or participating in an investigation, or any other activity related to the administration of this Policy. Any adverse discrimination or other action or behaviour that constitutes an offense will be reported to the police.

Obvious provides equal opportunities to its employment, consultancy or otherwise without regard for the Discrimination Characteristics. All actions of Obvious with regard to its employees, consultants, advisors, interns and staff, including but not limited to those relating to compensation, benefits, transfers, leave, layoffs, training, education, and assistance, will be made without regard for the Discrimination Characteristics.

Notwithstanding anything contained in the previous paragraph, if Obvious reasonably believes that its employment, workplace or premises do not adequately represent the balance of diversity of persons who share one or more of the Discrimination Characteristics, it may, with the aim only of redressing that imbalance, take positive discriminatory action in respect of persons who share that aspect, or those aspects, of the Discrimination Characteristics that are sought to be adequately represented.

When necessary, the company will reasonably accommodate employees and applicants with disabilities if the person is otherwise qualified to safely perform all of the essential functions of the position.
