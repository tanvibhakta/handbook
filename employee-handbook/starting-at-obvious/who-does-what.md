# Who Does What

Figuring out who to bring a particular issue or question to shouldnâ€™t be a guessing game. Most concerns fall pretty clearly within the responsibility of a specific team at Obvious, and the head of that team should be the first point of contact. At the same time, every single person who works at Obvious is approachable and friendly, more than willing to point you in the right direction. If you have a question, you're probably not the first, so speak up!

Below you'll find a list of the major groups and teams within the company. They're listed in alphabetical order by group name first and then, when relevant, by team. Inside groups/teams, people are listed in alphabetical order by last name, and the most senior people in a group/team are shown in bold.
