# The Obvious Library

We have a set of books in our library at the Obvious HQ. They're catalogued using Libib, and [are publicly viewable here](https://obvious.libib.com/). You are also welcome to borrow them - just make sure you take good care of them, and return them to us within two-three weeks.
