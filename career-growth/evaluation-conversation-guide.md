# Evaluation Conversation Guide

### Long-term goals: 

* They continue to have a sense of what they can contribute to the team.
* The team member continues to be engaged in the work.
* They are aware of and ready for changes and flux in the team/ clients work/ market etc
* The team member stays in the org.

### Immediate goals: 

* They walk into the room not experiencing a power differential; are okay with “being judged”, which is what an assessment really is. 
* The review conversation is net positive for the team member, even if feedback shared includes what they did well, what they didn’t.
* They are on the same page as you - they understand \(and accept in due time\) the numbers, rating, feedback you have given them.
* They are in the frame of mind to disagree but commit.
* They are not angry/ upset or losing confidence in their own ability.  
* They feel safe with you to want to have a future conversation about what this all means.

### Preparing for the conversation:

    <tr>

        your life to drive that point home</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">They internalise this. In a review discussion, if there isnt overwhelming
        progress, the reviewed person tends to beat themselves up. This is to get
        them to embrace failures as well.</td>

        <p>Disagreements.

        <p>This is their conditioning more than a personal disagreement with you.
          Whatever they say to you at this stage is useful to understand their worries
          and fears, so listen, take time to process, and see how you can use this
          to make them more comfortable, and feel they are safe, despite having shared
          their fears.</p>
