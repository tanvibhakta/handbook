# Evaluations Guide

## A 360° process

Evalutions are done in a comprehensive and transparent manner, facilitated by the manager. 

1. Each person self-evaluates themselves. 
2. Everyone in a project team evaluates each other. 
   * To prevent bias, no one should be able to see someone else’s evaluation of a person!
3. Everyone gets evaluated by their manager. 
4. Manager collates all the evaluations and aggregates them.  
5. The consolidated feedback is shared by the manager in a 1:1 conversation with each individual. 

## Guidelines for feedback

{% hint style="success" %}
Please **make a copy** of this template to write the feedback, and share it with your manager once you're done: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LauPbT-gP\_XxfQifYsuGrXA2kIeX4AjnnWZKhufd3Yw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LauPbT-gP_XxfQifYsuGrXA2kIeX4AjnnWZKhufd3Yw/edit?usp=sharing)
{% endhint %}

* Specific examples everywhere are important! Use the [situation-behaviour-impact framework](../employee-handbook/conversations/feedback-conversations.md#situation-behaviour-impact-model) to make your case. 
* To ensure that someone _definitely_ lies on a specific milestone,[ remember the 5Cs](design-growth-framework.md#the-framework)! 
* In case you don't have sufficient information about a facet, please talk the person and your manager. A year is a long period of time, and it is good to get clarification in case you think you're forgetting something. 
* Feedback provided in an evaluation **cannot** come as a surprise to the person. Such a data point will be disregarded. All comments -- positive and negative -- should be a summary of the feedback provided through the course of day to day work. 

### Examples of feedback

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please refer [to the template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LauPbT-gP_XxfQifYsuGrXA2kIeX4AjnnWZKhufd3Yw/edit?usp=sharing) for the level of detail that is expected in your feedback.

* “I've not only watched a promising product take shape under your guidance, but I've also learned a lot about the design process through this journey. I'm a huge fan of how you run the design sprints, and how you're able to harness the ideas of multiple people in the service of a common goal. I also have marvelled at your ability to translate a seemingly subjective, non-linear activity \(the design process\)  to a series of repeatable processes.”
* “There are some aspects of collaboration that could improve, however. While most of us appreciate the directness of your approach in giving feedback, how direct one can be is a function of the prevailing trust, which may take time to build. I've seen that in some cases, people can feel intimidated by your approach. I’ve seen ABC and XYZ go into their shells around you.” 
* “The regular rhythm of working together \(face-to-face\) is not in good shape. If we can get back all of us in the rhythm of 3 days working together in the same room and rest 2 days working remotely, it would be really helpful to make sure everything is on track. I feel working remotely doesn't give the speed and confidence so more face-to-face collaboration could be a key to move fast.” 
* “I’ve seen a huge difference in the speed of finalizing decisions and moving forward when you're present with us during problem-solving but as a team, we've to ensure we should move at the same speed when you're not there as well. I hope we'll be able to find a solution together for this. The level of clarity we have is completely amazing when you're there in the room.”
