# Engineering Growth Framework

## Introduction

We strongly believe that people produce great work when they are at their natural best. Forcefully reducing them to _experts vs generalists_, or _individual contributors vs managers_, hampers their growth instead of boosting it.

At Obvious, we look for multi-faceted, [T-shaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) individuals, who bring a lot to the table other than just their craft. To nurture and accelerate the growth of such people, over the years we've experimented with several different frameworks. We've finally resolved to the one that follows.

This framework is inspired by the fantastic [work done by the folks at Medium](https://medium.com/s/engineering-growth-framework/engineering-growth-introduction-8ba7b78c8d6c).

## The Framework

The framework is divided into 3 parts - **Creating**, **Executing** and **Supporting**, each of which has 3-4 different skills. Each skill is further divided into 5 different milestones. As you go deeper, or take on more responsibilities, you cross a milestone. 

In general, you must have demonstrated a "Conscious, Comfortable, Continuous, Consistent Competency" defined as follows:

* **Conscious:** having devoted intentional effort to this endeavour,
* **Comfortable:** without being overly stretched,
* **Continuous:** for a reasonable period of time,
* **Consistent:** reliably and evenly,
* **Competency:** meeting the criteria.

{% hint style="info" %}
As a natural consequence, you do not achieve a milestone _the first time_ you demonstrate relevant behaviours or tasks. If it is not clear that you're at a certain milestone, then you'll be placed at the previous milestone.
{% endhint %}

Here's what the skills and the corresponding milestones look like:

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Evaluation

Each milestone is significantly harder to cross than the previous one, which is reflected in the number of points assigned to the milestones.

If someone is not meeting expectations for Milestone 1, then they are assumed to be at Milestone 0 with 0 points. One does not start at Milestone 1 in every track. 

{% hint style="info" %}
During evaluation, if it appears that an engineer is between milestones, then they reside at the lower milestone. One cannot be given points "halfway through" a milestone. 
{% endhint %}

| Milestone | Points             |
| :---: | :--- |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 12 |
| 5 | 20 |

Some engineers may find that they exhibit some of the example behaviours at a later milestone without exhibiting all of the example behaviours at an earlier milestone. _This is to be expected!_ At the earlier stages of an engineer’s career, they are limited to simple contributions. Engineers with more experience can typically contribute in higher leverage ways which supersede those simpler tasks, meaning they no longer do them. It is assumed they could do them, _should_ they be required to.

Through a 360 degree evaluation process, everyone at Obvious is assessed across the 11 different skills and assigned points in each skill based on the milestone they've crossed. The cumulative sum of these points forms a score, which corresponds to a level in our career ladder.

| **Points** | **Level**       |
| :---: | :--- |
| 7 | 1.1 |
| 12 | 1.2 |
| 17 | 1.3 |
| 23 | 2.1 |
| 29 | 2.2 |
| 35 | 2.3 |
| 42 | 3.1 |
| 49 | 3.2 |
| 56 | 3.3 |
| 64 | 4.1 |
| 74 | 4.2 |
| 86 | 4.3 |
| 100 | 5.1 |
| 116 | 5.2 |
| 136 | 5.3 |

At Obvious, we do not have designations, so we think of these levels in terms of the following 5 bands:

| **Bands** | **Levels**                                    |
| :--- | :--- |
| Associate Engineer | 1.1 - 1.3 |
| Engineer | 2.1 - 2.3 |
| Senior Engineer | 3.1 - 3.3 |
| Principal Engineer | 4.1 - 4.3 |
| Engineering Leader | 5.1 - 5.3 |
