# Our Hiring Philosophy

At Obvious, we are always looking to get in touch with interesting craftspeople who are not only very good at what they do, but also very passionate about it. We might not have an opening throughout the year, but we believe that these interactions and conversations should be facilitated because they in turn lead to mutually beneficial long-term engagements. 

Obvious takes an active interest in the overall design and engineering community in India. We are not restricted with just immediate hiring needs. Our team members try to contribute to the ecosystem as much as possible by [speaking at events](https://obvious.in/talks-appearances/) all over the world, we [host mini-events](https://twitter.com/womendroid?lang=en) at office for promoting diversity in design and engineering community, we help new designers and engineers with career tips and portfolio reviews through our [OOOhours initiative](https://ooohours.com/), and we are always looking for more ways in which we can contribute to the long term health of the community. 

As a result of this outward focus, throughout the last few years, we have made friends with a lot of talented and interesting people who are all up to something wonderful. For us, the whole community can be divided into 3 parts:

* People who can work at Obvious in future
* People who are working at Obvious
* People who have already worked at Obvious and are now doing other things \(Obvious alumni\)

And we are on good terms with all. 

While extending an opportunity to someone to work together with us, we look for the following 3 important things, which are derived from [our core values](https://playbook.obvious.in/employee-handbook/introduction/obvious-core-values):

1. Commitment to craft
2. Value-fit
3. Openness and transparency

Commitment to craft is about taking a sense of ownership and pride in your work, to really care about everything you do. It also means valuing craft over self. Good craftspeople rise above differences with other craftspeople around them and appreciate others solely on their craft.

At Obvious, we are ardent believers that culture fit leads to a homogeneous team and we don't look for culture fit. On the contrary, we believe in diversity. One of our core values is to fight the default of exclusion. While looking at a potential team member, we look how our values are aligned, in spite of whatever cultural background or experience people have had. When people with same values work together, diversity is actually an enabler. 

Openness and transparency helps in building a productive workplace. Humble people who communicate their thought process openly and give/receive feedback in a helpful manner   increase the overall quality of work output, as well as help in building trust and mutual respect among coworkers. This openness and transparency extends beyond the workplace - to the client and to the users for whom we are designing the products.
