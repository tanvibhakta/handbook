# Design Hiring

## Step 1 -  Answer the "Opinion Questions"

As a team, we're quite an opinionated bunch! It helps us listen to everyone - we end up learning from each other's point of view. So, to know you better, we ask you to write down answers to these 6 questions:

1. Tell us about your favourite piece of your own work. What do you love about it and why? 
2. What would make Obvious a great workplace for you? 
3. What would make Obvious a terrible workplace for you? 
4. What are the 3 most important design principles you truly hold dear? What are your favourite books on those principles and why? 
5. Is there something in the Obvious playbook that you would like to see changed or improved? Please go beyond visual design recommendations.
6. What has your recent design related learning been like? Tell us about books/ magazines/ other sources you have learnt from and what those learnings have been.

We're looking for clarity of thought and tight articulation. There are no right or wrong answers to these questions. All of us have very different thoughts on them, shaped by our experiences, and we hope your answers will make for a riveting discussion.

## Step 2 - Get on a Screening Call

If your answers indicate that you and Obvious might be a good fit for each other, we’ll set up a screening call with you. It’ll be brief - half an hour tops. 

The screening call helps us understand your expectations, and how might we play a role in meeting them.  

## Step 3 - Spend a Day at Obvious 

If the results of the screening call are positive, you’ll be invited to spend a Day at Obvious. This will be split into 2 parts: 

1. A presentation of your work to the team
2. Interviews with your future colleagues 

At the end of your Day at Obvious, you will be evaluated on our [design growth rubric](https://playbook.obvious.in/career-growth/design-growth-framework) by all of your interviewers. 

### And that’s it! 

Once the entire hiring process is over, and it looks like you and Obvious might be a good fit for each other, you will receive an offer letter from us within a week. If you don’t, we’ll be sure to leave you with some  constructive feedback.
